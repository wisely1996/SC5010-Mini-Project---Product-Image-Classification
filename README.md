# SC5010-Mini-Project-Product-Image-Classification
About
---
A mini project for our course SC5010 - Introduction to Data Analysis, we obtained our dataset from Kaggle and used Tensorflow to form a CNN in order to create an Image Classification model to classify product images from [Shopee](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shopee-product-detection-open/overview), resized and reuploaded by a [kaggle user](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tanyongkeong/shopee-code-league-2020-product-detection?select=train.csv).

Problem Definition
---
* Correctly classify images of topwear and bottomwear

Model Layers
---
1. 8 CNN Layers, with ReLu as activation in each layer
2. Flattening and Dropout layer
3. 3 Dense Layers
4. Optimized with Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) 

Outcome of Project
---
* Classification Accuracy of 93.57%

Conclusion
---
* Model may be underperfoming considering the potential of how powerful CNNs are
* Ways to improve:
  * Test out with more hyperparameters to improve model
  * Including a neutral class (neither top nor bottom)

Learning Points
---
* Exploring high-level operation 'shutil'
* Building a Convolution Neural Network Layer from scratch
* Gradient Descent vs Adam Optimizers
* Ensemble CNN
* K-fold Cross Validation on top of CNN
